    "The Gene Ontology (GO) provides a framework for association between a specific gene product and a GO concept. These concepts are organized in 3 key aspects of the biological domain: molecular function, cellular component of action, and biological process. Molecular function defines the activities of gene products like catalysis, not specifying when, where,... they take place. On the other hand the cellular component aspect would describe the location of a gene product in the cell. Finally, the category of biological process represents multi molecular activities resulting in bigger biological processes for example DNA repair (https://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-documentation/, 23.10.). \n",
    "Every GO class or term has a unique GO ID consisting of 7 digits, an aspect (molecular function, ...), a definition and also a relationship to other terms (https://geneontology.org/docs/GO-term-elements, 23.10.). This aims to unify representation of genes and their products and provide a resource for consistent annotation (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24524070/, 23.10.). "

After the results are shown, they were filtered with Rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the UniProt ID P06238 was found. Going to the BLAST header and entering P06238 in the first search 'Find a protein sequence...' leads to this amino acid sequence in FASTA format starting with the start codon or amino acid Methionine:   \n",
