Linear regression 
==================

Inside the "linear regression <group number>.csv" files are datasets of concentrations and corresponding absorption values from a UV/VIS determination of protein concentration. Using this dataset, carry out the following steps to establish a calibration: 

1. determine the linear range of the method
2. calculate the calibration curve
3. determine the LOD and LOQ of the calibration
