The **coolwarm** colormap is unsuitable for this use case as it assigns red only to the very highest scalar density values, while the majority of the range is mapped to white. This results in a visualization where most structures appear washed out, with minimal color variation to differentiate between density ranges. Furthermore, the **geom** opacity function exacerbates the issue by assigning opacity only to the very highest density values, leaving most of the volume, including the bones (which are not as dense as the highest regions), nearly completely transparent. Consequently, the combination of the colormap and opacity function results in a visualization where almost nothing is rendered, making it ineffective for highlighting bone structures.
