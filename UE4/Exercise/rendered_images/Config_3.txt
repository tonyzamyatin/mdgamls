The **gray** colormap is neutral and does not emphasize scalar variations through color, making it entirely dependent on the opacity function and blending mode to reveal internal structures. Using **reverse linear opacity** assigns higher opacity to lower scalar values and lower opacity to higher scalar values, which is the opposite of what is typically needed for visualizing dense structures like bones. As a result, the low-density regions (e.g., air or soft tissue) are completely opaque, obscuring the high-density regions entirely. This produces a solid gray cube with no transparency or visible internal structures, as the high-opacity low-density regions dominate the visualization.
