The **bone** colormap is the ideal choice for this task as it is specifically tailored for medical imaging, offering smooth transitions from black to white that are well-suited for highlighting dense structures like bones. The **sigmoid_20** opacity function is also optimal, as it assigns linear opacity values to scalar densities within the range of -20 to 20. This ensures that medium-density tissues are appropriately transparent, while high-density structures like bones remain prominently visible. Adding **shading** further enhances the 3D perception of the structures, making it easier to understand spatial relationships within the volume. Finally, the **maximum** blending function is perfect for accentuating high-density bone tissue by prioritizing their contribution over surrounding low-density regions. Based on experimentation, this configuration delivers the clearest and most detailed visualization for this dataset, effectively highlighting the bones.
