The **plasma** colormap, which is perceptually linear, transitions smoothly from light pink for low-density tissues to yellow for high-density regions
. While perceptually uniform, the color scheme is not ideal for visualizing bone structures, as it does not provide an intuitive distinction between
high-density and medium-density tissues. The absence of **shading** further reduces the perception of the 3D structure, making it challenging to discern depth and spatial relationships. However, adding shading might not complement the colormap effectively due to its reliance on color rather than light and shadow contrast. The **sigmoid** opacity function performs better than the linear one for this use case. Opacity increases exponentially in the lower half of the scalar range and logarithmically in the upper half (following a sigmoid curve). While this improvement makes the bones more visible, the opacity of medium-density tissues, such as cartilage, remains too high. This results in "pinkish mushy blobs" that obscure the finer details of the bone structure. Using the **maximum** blending function effectively accentuates the bones by prioritizing their higher scalar values over those of surrounding tissues, making the bones more distinct and prominent in the visualization.
