The **viridis** colormap, which is perceptually linear, provides good visual contrast, with bluish tones representing low-density tissue and greenish-yellow tones highlighting high-density tissue. However, the **linear** opacity transfer function, combined with the **composite** blending function, does not sufficiently emphasize the high-density bone structures. This is because the **linear** opacity function assigns opacity values proportionally to the scalar density values. Consequently, soft tissues are assigned relatively high opacity values, which dominate the visualization and reduce the clarity of high-density structures. The **composite** blending function further averages these contributions, producing a somewhat "mushy" appearance. Switching to a blending function like **maximum** would better highlight the high-density bone structures by prioritizing their contributions over those of the surrounding tissue.
