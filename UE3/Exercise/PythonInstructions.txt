We suggest to work with Anaconda as it creates a new environment, with name NAME
without affecting any others and can be deleted after this course.
If you work with Anaconda, the following commands will create your environment, it is similar with pip.

conda create -n NAME python=3.9
conda activate NAME
conda install pydicom==2.4.3
conda install scipy==1.11.3
conda install matplotlib (Note: downgrading is fine)
conda install tk (It should already be installed, but just to be safe)

The code has been tested with PyCharm, Jupyter might not work.

When creating a "New Project" with PyCharm, select the folder you want to work in, for example the one
containing your datasets. For Python Interpreter select "Previously configured interpreter" and browse for
your "Conda Environment", should be in YourUser/anaconda3/envs/NAME/python.exe. You want to
create from existing source.
